# WARNING, IF SOMEONE HAS ACCESS TO YOUR IP THEY COULD LOG ALL YOUR KEYS, PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHILE USING

# How to setup

* Make sure python is installed, you can install it here: https://www.python.org/downloads
* Download the following python libraries (If you don't know how, search for a tutorial on youtube or ask me): flask, gevent, keyboard, pyautogui
* Run API.py
* Put in your IP and the port number 4888 and then run Main.lua in roblox emulator (you can find your private IP by opening terminal and typing ipconfig)

# How to fix

* Try exiting out of API.py and openning it again, sometimes it needs 2 or 3 tries to work.
* Ask me if the previous methods didn't work.

# Notes

This script isnt very useful now that I think about it lol.
